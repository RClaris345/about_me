    <p>Hello my name is Clarissa Rivas. I am a straight forward gal with a dry/dark sense of humor. I love puns and reading about psychology. I love my dogs and I love food too. I recently became vegan and I am suffering.</p>
     
    <p>I am taking this class to change my life. Sounds typical but it is true and I think this is the chance. What keeps me inspired is reminding myself what I want for myself and more importantly what I want for my family. I want to make this a career and eventhough I have no idea what I am doing YET, I know I will work hard and catch on to these concepts. The hardest thing for me might be trying to understand the concepts but everyday it gets better and that gives me hope.</p>
